# Write Yourself A Git!

This project is an attempt to recreate git in python in order to help me understand the inner workings of one of my favorite pieces of software. The commit history here may be sparse as my orginal git repo got corrupted during development of this tool. The guide followed in creation of this tool can be found [here](https://wyag.thb.lt/#orgd67fd88). I'd love to take the time to approach this project again using C so that the code is more efficient and more accurately represents the git source code. Git is very particular about the contents of files and structure which this project attempts to emulate with some imperfections. It would be great to go back and try to correct these as well. Overall this project was a fantastic learning experience and I highly reccomend other develpers to try it.
